  High-performance in-memory cache module powered by QuickLeaf.
  
  **Actions:**
  - `set`: Store a key-value pair in cache with optional TTL
  - `get`: Retrieve a value by key
  - `remove`: Remove a key-value pair from cache
  - `clear`: Clear all items from cache
  - `exists`: Check if a key exists in cache
  - `list`: List cache entries with filtering and ordering
  - `cleanup`: Manually clean up expired items
  - `stats`: Get cache statistics and information
  
  **Features:**
  - O(1) access time for get/set operations
  - TTL (Time To Live) support with automatic expiration
  - LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
  - Advanced filtering (prefix, suffix, pattern matching)
  - Ordered listing with pagination support
  - Real-time statistics
  
  **Usage Examples:**
  
  Store data:
  ```yaml
  - use: cache
    input:
      action: set
      key: "user:123"
      value: { name: "Alice", role: "admin" }
      ttl: 3600  # Optional TTL in seconds
  ```
  
  Retrieve data:
  ```yaml
  - use: cache
    input:
      action: get
      key: "user:123"
  ```
  
  List with filtering:
  ```yaml
  - use: cache
    input:
      action: list
      filter_type: "prefix"
      filter_value: "user:"
      order: "asc"
      limit: 10
  ```
